x_pos is the starting x position
y_pos is the starting y position
x_speed and y_speed are their respective starting velocites
gravity is how much the y changes every "turn"
seconds have no effect except visually, so dont change them probably
wind is the same as gravity except sideways (positive wind goes away from x = 0)
